<span style="background-color: transparent; color: #333333; font-size: 16px; vertical-align: baseline;">The United Transnational Republics
The United Transnational Republics is the first known “3GO”: a Global Governmental Grassroots Organisation working towards the democratisation of the globalised world we find ourselves in:
Democracy as we know it since the last two centuries only takes place within nation-states. At the same time globalisation happens globally, outside of national definitions, legislation or agreements.
Obviously, there is no democratic representation of the individual on a transnational, global level. This leads to inherently undemocratic processes within globalisation. Currently, outside of the nation-states only consumer and national interests are being represented. Unfortunately, both our national as well as our consumer interests are in conflict with our global interest: the preservation of our environment, world peace, establishment of transnational legislation etc...
In order to realise democracy on a global level, the current political system needs to be expanded by one more federal level of representation: Citizen of a city, of a country, of a Transnational Republic.
In this system all citizens of the world will be represented by their Transnational Republic of choice; together, the various Transnational Republics are forming The United Transnational Republics, where they are representing their citizens’ transnational interests - just as the various nation-states are assembling into The United Nations representing national interest.
In order to assure the independence of The United Transnational Republics from the nation-states and in order to establish money as the “fourth power” of democracy, the Central Bank of The United Transnational Republics is issuing the transnational citizen currency PAYOLA. A very similar global monetary system (the BANCOR) was the British proposal promoted by Sir Meynard Keynes at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944; unfortunately it was decided to make the US-dollar the global key currency instead. To a great part, this decision made the military and economic expansion of the USA possible and led to a US-centred globalisation.
Currently, the First Transnational Republic has around 5.000 citizens from 100 nation-states.
The United Transnational Republics presented at the first UNESCO summit on globalisation and democracy in Buenos Aires (2006), the UNESCO conference on globalisation and participation in Monterrey (2007) and participated at well over 60 other international conferences, exhibitions, seminars, workshops in the fields of politics and art (Torino Biennial, Venice Biennial, attac summer academy, Kunsthalle Hamburg, Münchner Kammerspiele, Palais de Tokyo Paris).
1. We have global problems but only local governments.
2. We need global citizen representation in order to tackle global issues.
3. Running the world on national and corporate goals will only aggravate global problems.
4. If we the people want to participate in globalization, we better get organized. Bottom-up and not top-down.</span>
