Dear Susanne, thank you for introducing this link: the example appears to be problematic, for two reasons

1.) the sum of 1+3+10 =14 ("Each suggestion's sum of resistance points gives the group resistance against that proposal") equals 14 and not 13 (raw uncorrected as entered in the referred table)

2.) the missing consensus input of [[unpartei/UWE|UWE]][[http://google.com/search?q=UWE|➜°]] naturally interprets as a "don't care" and could get automatically a zero resistance value instead of a five for indecided.
Apart from these minor nuisances, [[unpartei/DooCracy|DooCracy]][[http://google.com/search?q=DooCracy|➜°]] solves the decision problem in a nonlinear way:
For example:

1.) [[unpartei/HENRY|HENRY]][[http://google.com/search?q=HENRY|➜°]] invites people to a Barbecue by offering on his [[unpartei/WikiHomepage|WikiHomepage]][[http://google.com/search?q=WikiHomepage|➜°]] a party. He invites people and asks for their acceptance/denial in due time and negotiates conditions (sharing resources). As Default he claims, the party will start with at least 3 guests, meeting the conditions. If the conditions are met, he takes the overall responsibility to prepare the party.
...
Instead of a Barbecue take the Camping example in the Video: [[unpartei/WhatIsAWikiInPlainEnglish|WhatIsAWikiInPlainEnglish]][[http://google.com/search?q=WhatIsAWikiInPlainEnglish|➜°]]: http://youtu.be/-dnL00TdmLY

in the same way anyone else offers their own (negotiatable and collaboratively modifiable) solution.

The winning alternative will be the one, where most people show their readiness by contributing to the details of the different proposals.

An additional benefit of this dynamic doocratic solution (which works as a multithread process) is, that next time some preparation for another alternative may be already half-finished, thus reducing the overall efforts of the group process.

Joke: Every idiot can decide by emotional resistance, but it takes and makes competent peers to openly collaborate to build constructive solutions for the wellbeing of all people involved and beyond. [[unpartei/BeABuilder|BeABuilder]][[http://google.com/search?q=BeABuilder|➜°]] not a mindless "decider"... .

On the other hand [[unpartei/SC|SC]][[http://google.com/search?q=SC|➜°]] has its benefits, compared to the even more mindless system of majority voting on options, that are not made by the voters themselves.
